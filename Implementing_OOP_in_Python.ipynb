    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A blueprint specifies that every house will have a **door**, **windows**, and **rooms**.\n",
    "- However, the blueprint itself is not a house‚Äîit is just a plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in Python, a **class** defines the structure and behavior (methods) that its objects will have, but it does not represent an actual object until you create one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the class as the **template** for creating objects. Each object created from the class can have its own unique properties while following the same structure defined by the class.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### For example:\n",
    "- If the class is a blueprint for a house, the object is the actual house built from that blueprint.\n",
    "- Each object can have its own unique properties (e.g., color, size) while following the structure defined by the class.\n",
